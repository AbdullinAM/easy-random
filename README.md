## What is jPopulator ?

jPopulator is a java library that allows you to populate java beans with random data.

Populating a deep type hierarchy by hand is a tedious task and the goal of jPopulator is to make this task easy.

Let's see an example, suppose you have the following classes:

![](https://github.com/benas/jPopulator/raw/master/site/person.png)

If you want to populate a `Person` bean with jPopulator, you write this snippet:

```java
Populator populator = new PopulatorBuilder().build();
Person person = populator.populateBean(Person.class);
```

And voila! jPopulator will introspect the `Person` type hierarchy, generate an instance for each nested bean and populate it with random data.

**Without** jPopulator, you would write something like:
 
 ```java
 Street street = new Street(12, (byte) 1, "Oxford street");
 Address address = new Address(street, "123456", "London", "United Kingdom");
 Person person = new Person("Foo", "Bar", "foo.bar@gmail.com", Gender.MALE, address);
 ```
 
 And if these classes do not provide constructors with parameters (may be some legacy beans you don't have the control over), you would write:
 
 ```java
 Street street = new Street();
 street.setNumber(12);
 street.setType((byte) 1);
 street.setName("Oxford street");
 
 Address address = new Address();
 address.setStreet(street);
 address.setZipCode("123456");
 address.setCity("London");
 address.setCountry("United Kingdom");
 
 Person person = new Person();
 person.setFirstName("Foo");
 person.setLastName("Bar");
 person.setEmail("foo.bar@gmail.com");
 person.setGender(Gender.MALE);
 person.setAddress(address);
 ```
 
It's always tedious to generate test data by hand, and jPopulator makes this task easier.
